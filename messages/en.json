      "title": "What is ConvergENS?",
      "body": "ConvergENS is the collective that brings together the engaged associations and clubs of the École normale supérieure (ENS), in connection with student parties and unions.\nIt arose from a double frustration: on the one hand, often small association boards bending under the weight of volunteer work; on the other, new volunteers forced to choose between causes that speak to them just as much.\nConvergENS provides a shared space to follow each organization’s updates and keep the connection. From within the ENS, by coming together, we surface lines of convergence — and we also discuss the divides — across our struggles."

      "title": "How does ConvergENS work?",
      "body": "ConvergENS is not an umbrella structure over its members, but a collective that brings them together. Associations and clubs are the decision-makers and vote in the General Assembly on everything concerning the collective (upcoming events, welcoming new members, etc.). Parties and unions are invited members: they contribute in particular to Agora (ConvergENS’ journal) and to its launch conferences.\nTo join ConvergENS, simply get involved in a member (or invited) organization and become its representative within the collective."
